# GW2-Movie-Collection
ERROR 404 - Hunter Johnson and Ethan Buchanan

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

The Program:
This program is designed to maintain and sort a collection of movies, sorting alphabetically by name and then writing
out the collection to a new file of desired name.
The features of this program include: reading and writing from and to a file; adding and removing movies from a collection; searching for
specific movies by name; and searching for all movies by a director. 

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Running the Program:
To run the program simply run the makefile to create an executable then run the executable ./movielibrary, however the prerequisites to running the program
is to make sure the file with the movies and thier information exists as well as is in the format:
- Movie name \n
- Director name \n
- Movie Runtime
- Format \n
- Price \n
- Release Year \n
- ...and so on

Challenges:
The challenges on this one was trying to make sure we included all of the required parts of the assignment, as well as trying to figure out
how the list library worked.
This time the majority of the challenges came from how we wanted it to look and figuring out how to make our menu colorful; Like seriously the majority of
the challenges came from how much we wanted stuff spaced out, a whole arguement over the gaps between the lines of information.

Sharing the Work:
Sharing the work was easier this time around, where Hunter would do the typing whilst Ethan sat next to him on google and figuring out how things work and
looking up lists and other library functions.
Hunter is the one typing this README, whilst Ethan is doing the comments.
Ethan did the majority of the Menu work in Main (those switch cases are all him), whilst Hunter did most of the typing for the .cpp and its functionality.
Ethan did both header files, both for the struct and for the class.
All in all it felt pretty well divided
